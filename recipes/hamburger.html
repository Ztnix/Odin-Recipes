    <h1>Hamburger</h1>

    <img src="../images/Hamburgesa.jpg" alt="Hamburger = Nice">

    <p>The secret to incredibly juicy burger patties is the addition of crushed crackers or panko breadcrumbs to hold in the natural fat and juices.</p>

    <p>We definitely recommend using crackers if you have them. Adding crushed crackers is an old-school method to add more flavor than plain breadcrumbs. 
       Plus, its super handy for using up that package of crackers you've had sitting in the pantry for weeks.</p>
    
    <h2>Here is everything you need to make the best homemade hamburger patties:</h2>


        <ul>


        <li>Ground chuck  We prefer an 80 lean/20 fat ratio for the juiciest burgers.</li>
        <li>Crushed crackers or Panko bread crumbs  The best binders for juicy hamburgers. (Could be gluten-free!)</li>
        <li>Worcestershire sauce  Adds a deep beefy, smoky flavor.</li>
        <li>Egg  To bind all of the ingredients together without drying.</li>
        <li>Milk  The enzymes help to soften and tenderize the ground beef.</li>
        <li>Seasonings: Salt, Garlic Powder, Onion powder, Pepper, or other spices of choice.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Here are the steps:</h3>

    <p>It seriously only takes mere minutes to make restaurant-quality hamburgers from scratch. Prep your workspace and ingredients 
        before getting started and you’ll be whipping out hot plates from your home kitchen (or backyard) in no time!</p>

        <ol>
    <li>First, set out a large mixing bowl and add in the ground beef, crushed crackers, egg, Worcestershire sauce, milk, and spices.</li>

    <li>Use your hands to thoroughly combine until the mixture is very smooth.</li>

    <li>Next, press the meat down in the bowl, into an even disk. Use a knife to cut and divide the hamburger patty mixture 
        into 6 – 1/3 pound grill or skillet patties, or 12 thin griddle patties. Like so:</li>

    <li>Set out a baking sheet, lined with wax paper or foil, to hold the patties. One at a time, gather the patty mix and
        press firmly into patties of your desired thickness. You typically want hamburger patties to be slightly larger 
        than the buns they’ll be served on since they’ll shrink a bit in the cooking process.</li>

    <li>Place the formed patties on the baking sheet. With thick patties, press
        an indentation in the center of each patty, so they don’t puff up while cooking.</li>

    <li>You can stack the patties with sheets of wax paper between layers if needed.</li>

    <li>Then, preheat the grill or a skillet to medium heat, approximately 350-400 degrees F.</li>

    <li>For thick patties: Grill or fry the patties for 3-4 minutes per side for a medium burger.</li>

    <li>For thin patties: Cook on the griddle for 2 minutes per side.</li>
</ol>
